# semit
A Chrome extension that reverses the characters of any New York Times headline

To install, download and run the .crx file in the main directory. Enable, and then it will reverse all headlines on any page at nytimes.com

The important code can be found in crx/semit.js

Enjoy! It's pretty silly.
